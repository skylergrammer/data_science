[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:34:09: <Michael Gordon> michael never actually finishes sentences
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:34:12: <Michael Gordon> he starts and stops
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:34:15: <Michael Gordon> goes on tangents
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:34:19: <Michael Gordon> really hard to follow
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:34:41: <Skyler Grammer> yeah

[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:35:21: <Skyler Grammer> it's another when people have no idea what the fuck is going on?
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:35:34: <Skyler Grammer> and what did he have to say about CCDs that you didn't already know?
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:35:56: <Michael Gordon> not a ton
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:36:08: <Michael Gordon> he was talking about shot noise

[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:37:32: <Michael Gordon> the only question he asked was 'What is dex?'
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:37:47: <Skyler Grammer> a lecture on how to breath would be appropriate for him
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:37:50: <Skyler Grammer> holy fuck
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:37:54: <Skyler Grammer> are you kidding me?

[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:38:25: <Michael Gordon> the funniest part is that we were just talking about how taryn asked the same thing her first year
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-14 13:38:42: <Michael Gordon> or rather, terry asked her to explain it in a presentation she gave, and she couldn;t

[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:47:32: <Michael Gordon> about nothing
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:47:44: <Michael Gordon> terry emailed us asking for a table of exposure times from our SOFIA observations
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:47:50: <Michael Gordon> i replied that i would handle it
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:47:56: <Michael Gordon> cuz i already have that info
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:48:11: <Michael Gordon> so dinesh chose to engage me in conversation to apologize for not being able to do it
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:48:17: <Michael Gordon> and all the reasons why he was too busy
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:48:24: <Michael Gordon> i was like, bro, chill

[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:48:31: <Michael Gordon> it takes 5 minutes
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:48:36: <Michael Gordon> it would be done by now

[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:50:10: <Skyler Grammer> and i guess they have made some analytical software that can auto-analyze basically any type of data
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:50:22: <Skyler Grammer> and it's written for tardsandwiches
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:50:31: <Michael Gordon> hahaha
[hangouts.pyc] 2014-10-15 10:50:49: <Skyler Grammer> so the interface is just like a google bar and you can type "what is the relationship between x,y,z and dildo sales?"
