Various Data Science Projects
=============================

This repository contains a subset of my various data science side projects. 

Contents
--------
1. vehicles_co2: predicting CO2 ouput based on engine displacement and gas mileage using a Kernel Ridge Regression algorithm from mply.  
2. wine_quality: predicting the quality of wine from physiochemical properties using a Back Propagating Neural Network from PyBrain.  
3. ML_linear_reg: implementation of gradient descent in python. Compares the solution to that of sklearn.  
4. mcpi.py: estimation of pi via Monte Carlo.  
5. loan_default: probability that a person will default on a loan given their debt, income, and demographics. Uses logistic regression to predict default likelihood.
